I am one [Debian developer](https://nm.debian.org/process/1339/) now, this is my the first time to archive one big goal in Open Source world. But 
DD is not final, just another start.

I have to admit I still have many things to learn on Debian, and I hope I can take on greater responsibilities
in the next journey. Thanks for all people who help me on this process, thanks to my team and lab.
