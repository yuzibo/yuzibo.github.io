# preface
I have to learn some usage about lvm on linux, so this is my notice about this. But this is not complete.

# extend volume in existing lv

```shell

sudo lvdisplay

Sorry, try again.

This is to check lv (logical volume) for existing lv.

```shell
 sudo vgdisplay
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               vg0
  System ID
  Format                lvm2
  Metadata Areas        1
  Metadata Sequence No  3
  VG Access             read/write
  VG Status             resizable
  MAX LV                0
  Cur LV                2
  Open LV               2
  Max PV                0
  Cur PV                1
  Act PV                1
  VG Size               1.80 TiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              472163
  Alloc PE / Size       35840 / 140.00 GiB
  Free  PE / Size       436323 / 1.66 TiB
  VG UUID               VCkz6D-Di19-Oh0a-GtaN-d9Th-sAqQ-ODNswr
```

This is vg (volume group) info. I think it can give you a picture of whole disk from lvm's view.

From above info, you will get the information about lv with its path.


```bash
sudo lvextend -L +200G /dev/vg0/srv
  Size of logical volume vg0/srv changed from 40.00 GiB (10240 extents) to 240.00 GiB (61440 extents).
  Logical volume vg0/srv successfully resized.

```

The command is to `extend` lv with path.

```bash
debian-buildd@unmatched05:~$ sudo resize2fs /dev/vg0/srv
resize2fs 1.46.6-rc1 (12-Sep-2022)
Filesystem at /dev/vg0/srv is mounted on /srv; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 5, new_desc_blocks = 30
The filesystem on /dev/vg0/srv is now 62914560 (4k) blocks long.
```

Using `resize2fs` to resize fs.

Verity again:

```bash
debian-buildd@unmatched05:~$ df -h /srv
Filesystem           Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg0-srv  236G  479M  226G   1% /srv
```
