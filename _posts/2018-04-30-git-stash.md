经过这么多次的git的操作，现在对这个工具更有深刻的认识了。

Imaging in a work scenes,after you `git clone git-project` and you "git checkout -b new_branch".When you have finished some works,for example,fix bug and orther operations, you are preparing `git push origin master`,But :), yes,you will face such scenes like that.

*Important*: Some people have updated "master branch",you felt bad because maintainer will not accept your change(There is called confilct).So, you must resolve it first.

How?

# Way 1st:
If you dont' t have commited your change,this is best scenes

1. In your local branch:

```git
git stash
```
The command will stash your local work, maybe *hint*.If you operate the step,the origin master will not note your change,so,

```git
git checkout master
```

2. Or some other branchs:

and

```git
git fetch origin master && git rebase origin master
```

3. 　Return your local branch

```git
git rebase origin/master
git stash pop
```

OK
